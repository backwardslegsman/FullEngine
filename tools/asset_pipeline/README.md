# Asset Pipeline Tooling

No importer or asset database tooling is implemented yet. The current renderer
milestone defines shared contracts and runtime descriptor validation only.

Future validation tools should consume authored assets, convert them to the
renderer-facing contracts in `docs/assets.md`, and report actionable errors
without depending on bgfx initialization or renderer-owned backend resources.

Expected first validation commands should cover:

- mesh units, handedness, winding, finite data, normals, tangents, bounds, and
  degenerate triangles
- texture dimensions, RGBA8 or future packed formats, semantic/color-space
  compatibility, mips, compression, and normal-map convention
- material texture slots, alpha policy, shadow compatibility, and fallback
  behavior
- terrain chunk dimensions, splat/weight maps, normal generation, LODs, and
  bounds
- skeleton hierarchy, inverse bind matrices, joint indices, influence counts,
  weights, and palette constraints

This directory intentionally does not contain editor UI, background streaming,
or runtime renderer ownership code.
